########################IMPORTANT CONTEXT#########################


Alright.  So we have all of the food pantries in Erie Coutny from FeedMore wny

SPCA_Maps/app.py is an app I built that opens 2 subapps
        SPCA_Maps/pages/1_Pantry_Map.py
        SPCA_Maps/pages/2_Vaccine_Map.py

For this app I want to get rid of the vaccine map all together.  The focus of this is exclusively pantry.


#########################STEP ONE#########################

So first things first, I want to scrape all of that.  So that is step one

the url is: https://www.feedmorewny.org/programs-services/find-food/pantry-locator/
but the whole thing has to have a bunch of filters in order to make it work.
So maybe if there is a way to like run it on an already open browser with the filters applied?
If not, I guess we can figure out how to manipulate it with the crawler.

Each pantry has the following info (followed by the full xpath of each element we want to scrape)

Name: 
        /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[15]/div/div[1]/span[1] 

Address - Made up of the following:
    [
        /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[15]/div/div[2]/span[1],
        /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[15]/div/div[2]/span[2],
        /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[15]/div/div[2]/span[3]

    ]

Phone#: 
        /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[15]/div/div[2]/span[4]


Hours of Operation:
        /html/body/div[1]/div[3]/div[2]/div/div[15]/div/div[2]/span[8]

        #########################STEP ONE B#########################
                I've gotta geocode that shit so I can have the lat and long for the pins



#########################STEP TWO#########################

Step 2 is cleaning up data from an old app and using it for this one.  


The app currently accesses user info and other data through a google drive.  We are going to just have it
live in this folder now though.  I took out all the personal identifiable information for clients with
the map.  And we are ultimatley giong to get rid of all of this shit in here anyway.  

To clean this data, we are going to take JUST the PantryMap.csv which now only has 
        Person ID and Postal Code.

Since we aren't putting a pin in every house, I don't think we need the procesed and geocoded shit maybe?  
Like can't we just run right off of the PatnryMap.csv (to count total Person ID's in each Postal Cod)
file and erie_survey_zips.geojson (to layout the zipcodes).  I think the other 2 jsons for pantry data were
just for putting pins in the map, which we aren't doing now.  

So now that I work through it, the only data cleanup you might have left is deleting
        SPCA_Maps/map_data/combined_survey_results.csv
        SPCA_Maps/map_data/geocoded_pantry_data.json
        SPCA_Maps/map_data/processed_pantry_data.json
but take a look at all the shit in SPCA_Maps to make sure you don't need it to build out parts 
of the app before deleting it.


#########################STEP THREE#########################


Step 3 is generating JUST the choloropleth map from the Pantry_Map app that I already have
and putting pins for all of the pantries.  They should be like green, pretty big, and have
like a shopping cart in them or something similar. We aren't going to have that year over year filter
to show growth, just the total client base as it stands now.

#########################STEP FOUR#########################

Step 4 is testing it by comparing it to the other app and seeing if the chloropleth match up.  
I gotta do that one on my own.  And if they don't then I start yelling at you.


#########################STEP FOUR#########################

Step 5 is putting theses pantry pins on top of the map and then I will look at it compared to the existing one and see how it looksst
